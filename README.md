# SmartVisionStick
To enhance battery efficiency, we implemented a low-power mode in the Arduino-based smart stick. The system automatically enters sleep mode when no obstacle or movement is detected for a certain duration. This reduces unnecessary power usage and extends battery life allowing longer operation on a single charge.
